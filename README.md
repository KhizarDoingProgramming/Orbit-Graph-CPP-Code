# Orbit-Graph-CPP-Code
This program in C++ represents an orbit graph, a type of directed or undirected graph where nodes represent celestial bodies (or points) and edges represent orbital paths between them. It typically uses adjacency lists or matrices to store connections and implements graph algorithms like DFS, BFS, or shortest path to analyze orbital relationships.
